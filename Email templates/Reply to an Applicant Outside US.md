Hey there,

Thank you for applying to one of our courses! We do appreciate your interest and efforts but unfortunately for now, our courses are specifically targeted at students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. We cannot accept your application at present, but know that we do have ambitions to widen our horizons. We already have programs in other countries such as Haiti and we are planning to expand to more areas as well.

If you sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), we will notify you when classes become available in your area.

In the meantime, there are a lot of resources out there for people interested in learning Android, and weâ€™ve done some work to make them more accessible. We have many [online resources for learning Android](https://support.codepath.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-can-i-get-started-learning-android-development-online) including an extensive [list of Android resources online](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources).

We hope to be able to bring programs to your area soon and expand our audience for future programs. We will gladly accommodate you by then. Thank you for your understanding.



All the best,           
CodePath.org Team
