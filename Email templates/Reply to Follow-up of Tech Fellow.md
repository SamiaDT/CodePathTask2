Hello Dennis,

Thank you for applying as a Tech Fellow at CodePath.org. We appreciate your interest and enthusiasm, and we would like to work with you soon.

As of the moment, we are in the process of waiting for another eligible Tech Fellow coming from your school to apply as Tech Fellow/complete his/her requirements. We need to have at least two eligible Tech fellows from the same school before we can admit them. Rest assured that there are no problems with your submitted requirements. After the matters with the other Tech Fellow/s are settled, we will inform you as soon as possible.

All the best,        
CodePath.org Team
