Hi Jake,
Thank you for your interest in our Android University course!

In response with your query about the next steps for your pre-work and the class schedule, kindly read on the details below. 

The pre-work incorporates a few steps:
1. Setup your Android environment
In this section, you will install and configure your local workstation for Android development, including all necessary tools such as Android Studio and Git, including configuring the emulator, setting up your first Android project, and using Git. You can follow the whole setup [playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrT2tZ9JRrf67-hE3a874RfBqJgVAwo71). Completing the setup can often take ~90 minutes. 

2. Build initial todo app
In this section, you will design, develop, and submit your first app: a simple todo list manager. You'll understand how to turn requirements into a design, wireframe a UI, and devise a strategy for systematically implementing features step-by-step. At the end, you'll learn how to publish your code to Github and submit your project via the CodePath course portal. The steps you learn in these videos will be used throughout the rest of the course. Completing and then submitting the initial todo app will likely take a few hours. You can build the app by [coding along with this video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk9CFqaeCCM&list=PLrT2tZ9JRrf6cHOlMkbmTMFt0RzpJiRGX&index=1).
3. Submit todo app for review via Github
All submissions happen via Github and we require each submission to follow a particular format, including a clearly documented README with a list of completed stories and a GIF app walkthrough. Once you have completed the ToDo application, pushed your code to GitHub with the README and GIF walkthrough included, you'll submit the project.
4. Add edit functionality to todo app
In this optional step, you will implement a new feature to allow users to edit the text of an item added to the list. For this task, the user should be able to tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
5. Extend your todo app, improve UI, add features
After initial submission, you may choose to iterate on the app by adding several advanced features to your todo app. If you are interested in pushing your knowledge, try your hand at implementing the following user stories and any other extensions of your own choosing:
    * (Suggested) Improve the UI / UX of your app including icons, styling, color, spacing of your app.
    * (Advanced) Improve style of the todo items in the list using a custom adapter
    * (Advanced) Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
    * (Advanced) Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
    * Anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality or user experience!

    In addition to adding features and UI polish, be sure to check out how to improve the organization of your code and meet the Android style guidelines by reviewing our guide on how to [organize your Android app files and folders](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Organizing-your-Source-Files).

    Be sure to include in the README an updated GIF walkthrough using LiceCap of the app demoing how it works with required user stories completed.
