Hello John!

CodePath.org is committed to providing college students with no-cost coding courses, mentorship, and career support to prepare them for careers in technology. For our goal, we subject our applicants to screening procedures. These screening procedures are not limited to the academic proficiency of the applicants as these also include other skills that are related to the courses. These assessment procedures help us to gauge what we need to teach our applicants. These will facilitate better learning and will prevent overwhelming the students with advanced levels of discussions. It is best to let students undergo foundation courses to master their skills before stepping up their education.

We would like to give you the best experience possible thus we cannot approve your request to transfer from the Beginner track to the Advanced track.

If you wish to continue with your Beginner track then we will gladly assist you. After this course, you are free to re-apply and try out for either the Intermediate or the Advanced track.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
